Greetings! The name is Jan-Michael Cabrera and I am a Mechanical Engineer by trade but with deep interests in math, science, and learning algorithms. This blog is mostly a space to document ideas I have related to these subjects such that my future self can look back and question my poor decisions.

I plan on having very little structure here. Mostly I just want to separate blogs into a kind of learning section where I summarize notes from textbooks or articles I'm currently reading, and a separate section that explores applying these ideas to learning algorithms. I'm very interested in how the brain works and information processing in general. 

I'll include a list of books I've read below recently that may help get to know my motivations better. I believe that you are what you consume and what you do, so getting some insight into what has patterend my brain may be insightful for those interested. I've read a lot of, I suppose you would call them, popular science books but feel I need to delve into textbooks and other concentrated learning material for further growth. Below that I'll also include a list of books I'm planning on revisiting or reading in the future to aid in my understanding of the world around me.

There are a lot more science fiction, fantasy, those popular science books, textbooks related to mechanical and chemical engineering, and tons of academic articles that I'll leave out for brevity.
