Greetings! The name is Jan-Michael Cabrera and I am a Mechanical Engineer by trade but with deep interests in math, science, and learning algorithms. This blog is mostly a space to document ideas I have related to these subjects such that my future self can look back and question my poor decisions.

I plan on having very little structure here. Mostly I just want to separate blogs into a kind of learning section where I summarize notes from textbooks or articles I'm currently reading, and a separate section that explores applying these ideas to learning algorithms. I'm very interested in how the brain works and information processing in general. 

I'll include a list of books I've read below recently that may help get to know my motivations better. I believe that you are what you consume and what you do, so getting some insight into what has patterend my brain may be insightful for those interested. Below that I'll also include a list of books I'm planning on revisiting or reading in the future to aid in my understanding of the world around me.
